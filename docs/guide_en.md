## 1. Overview

This tool automates the planetary imaging post-processing pipeline. Starting from raw SER video capture, it guides you through SER Crop → Lucky Stacking → quality assessment → de-rotation stacking → wavelet sharpening → RGB compositing → animation GIF → summary grid generation, all from within the GUI.

### 1.1 Camera Modes

This pipeline supports two camera modes.

| Mode | Description | Filter Setup |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| **Mono** | Monochrome camera with a filter wheel. Separate SER file per filter. | Multiple filters: IR, R, G, B, CH4, etc. |
| **Color** | Single color (Bayer) camera. Continuous capture without filter switching. | COLOR (single channel) |

Selecting the camera mode in Global Settings automatically switches the UI and parameters in Steps 03 and 06.

## 4. Step 01 — SER Crop

![Step 01 panel](images_en/step01.png)
*Figure 4-1: Step 01 panel — Left: form, Right: SER frame preview*

Built-in SER Crop preprocessing: crops SER videos centered on the planet and extracts the Region of Interest (ROI).

> **Optional Step**: This step can be skipped if your SER files are already cropped.

### 4.1 Parameters

| Parameter | Default | Range | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------|-------------|
| **SER Video Folder** | (Required) | — | Path to the folder containing SER files. Automatically searches all subfolders for `.SER` files. Browse with the `...` button or type the path directly. |
| **Output Folder** | Auto-set | — | Folder where SER Crop-processed SER files will be saved. |
| **ROI Size (px)** | 448 | 64–1024 (step 16) | Square crop size for SER Crop output. Set this large enough to encompass the planetary disc. |
| **Min Disc Diameter (px)** | 50 | 10–500 (step 5) | Minimum disc size to be considered a valid planet detection. Frames where the detected disc is smaller than this value are discarded as bad frames. |

### 4.2 Live Preview

The right panel shows a live preview.

- **Cyan box (Planet)**: Automatically detected planet region
- **Green box (ROI)**: The area that will be cropped to the set ROI size

The preview automatically refreshes when ROI size or minimum diameter changes.

## 5. Step 02 — Lucky Stacking

![Step 02 panel](images_en/step02.png)
*Figure 5-1: Step 02 panel — Lucky Stacking configuration (Left: controls, Right: AP grid preview)*

Selects the best frames from SER files and stacks them into TIF files using **per-AP independent lucky stacking**. Processing is fully automated within the pipeline — no external program required. When Step 01 is enabled, its SER output folder is automatically connected as input.

> **Optional Step**: If TIF stacks have already been created by an external tool, skip this step and specify the folder directly in Step 03.

### 5.1 Parameters

| Parameter | Default | Range | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------|-------------|
| **SER Input Folder** | (Required) | — | Folder containing the SER files to Lucky Stack. When Step 01 is enabled, the Step 01 output folder is connected automatically. Browse with the `...` button or type the path directly. |
| **Output Folder** | Auto-set | — | Folder where Lucky Stacking result TIF files are saved. Automatically set to `step02_lucky_stack` relative to the SER input folder. |
| **Top Frame % (%)** | 25 % | 5–100 % (step 5) | Only the top N% of frames by quality score are used for stacking. Lower value = stricter selection (sharper result, lower noise); higher value = more frames included (higher SNR). Use 10–25% on nights of good seeing, 50–75% on nights of poor seeing. |
| **AP Size (px)** | 64 | 32–128 (step 32) | Alignment Point size. Size of the sub-region used for local shift estimation. **64px = default (recommended)**. 32px = finer local alignment (slower), 128px = broader reference area (faster). |
| **Iterations** | 1 | 1–2 | Number of Lucky Stacking iterations. Each iteration refines the AP alignment reference using the previous stack result. **1** = default (fast); **2** = higher accuracy at ~2× processing time. |
| **Warp Method** | Gaussian KR | — | Local warp interpolation method. **Gaussian KR** (default): smooth, boundary-safe, fast. **TPS**: Thin Plate Spline, similar to AS!4 triangulation — sharper local transitions but slower. |
| **Fourier Quality Power** | 1.0 | 0.5–3.0 (step 0.5) | Exponent applied to each frame's Fourier amplitude when computing per-frequency weights: `w = │FFT│^power`. **1.0** = linear weighting (default, recommended). |
| **SER Parallel Workers** | 1 | 0–32 | Number of SER files to process simultaneously. **0** = auto (cpu_count ÷ 4). **1** = sequential (default, safe for low-RAM systems). **Warning: high values multiply RAM usage (~950 MB per SER)**. |
| **AS!4 AP Grid** | Off | — | When enabled, AP positions are generated using the same greedy Poisson-disc sampling (PDS) algorithm as AutoStakkert!4: three-tier radial density with denser coverage at the disc centre. When disabled, a uniform grid is used. The right-panel preview updates immediately when toggled. |
| **Debayer** | On | — | *(Color camera mode only)* Converts the Bayer-pattern stacked output to an RGB image. Required for Steps 05–08 to process the result correctly. Disable only when you need to inspect the raw Bayer stack. |

### 5.2 AP Grid Preview

The right panel shows the first frame from the selected SER folder overlaid with the AP (Alignment Point) grid.

- **AP (uniform)**: uniform grid, spacing = AP size ÷ 2.
- **AP (AS!4 PDS)**: three-layer Poisson-disc grid matching AutoStakkert!4 density — denser at the disc centre, sparser at the limb.

The preview refreshes automatically when AP size changes or the AS!4 AP Grid checkbox is toggled.

### 5.3 Stacking Algorithm

Lucky Stacking uses **Fourier-domain quality-weighted averaging** (Mackay 2013):

1. **Frame quality scoring**: Each frame is scored with the `log_disk` metric (Laplacian-of-Gaussian variance on the planet disc), matching AS!4's *lapl3* quality measure.
2. **Reference frame construction**: The top frames centred around the 75th-percentile quality rank are mean-stacked to form a stable reference (high-SNR, representative of "solidly good" seeing).
3. **Global alignment**: Each selected frame is sub-pixel aligned to the reference via limb-centre ellipse fitting.
4. **Fourier-domain stacking**: All aligned frames are transformed to the frequency domain. Each frequency component is accumulated with per-frame quality weighting `w(f) = |FFT(frame, f)|^power`, then inverse-transformed. This produces a stack that is sharper than a simple mean because high-quality (sharp) frames contribute more weight at high spatial frequencies.
5. **Gaussian rolloff**: A Gaussian filter (σ_f = 0.20 in normalised frequency units) is applied to the output spectrum before IFFT, suppressing residual high-frequency noise.

**Parallelism model** (e.g., 32 cores, 4 SER parallel):
```
Total thread budget = n_workers (default: all cores)
SER-level:  4 SER files processed simultaneously
Frame-level: each SER uses n_workers ÷ 4 = 8 threads
Peak active threads = 4 × 8 = 32 = n_workers
```

## 6. Step 03 — Quality Assessment & Window Detection

![Step 03 panel](images_en/step03.png)
*Figure 6-1: Step 03 panel — Quality assessment configuration*

Automatically evaluates the image quality of each TIF frame and enumerates all possible sliding windows chronologically for stacking.

> **Required Step**: This step cannot be skipped.

### 6.1 Parameters

| Parameter | Default | Range | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------|-------------|
| **Input Folder** | Auto-set | — | Automatically set to the Step 02 Lucky Stacking TIF folder. |
| **Output Folder** | Auto-set | — | Quality score CSVs and window recommendation JSON are saved here. |
| **Window (frames)** | 3 | 1–20 | De-rotation window length expressed as **number of filter cycles**. 1 frame = one complete filter cycle (IR→R→G→B→CH4). Actual window time = frames × filter cycle time. Example: 3 frames × 225s = 675s (~11 min). **Jupiter: 2–4 frames / Mars, Saturn: 3–6 frames** |
| **Filter cycle (sec)** | 225 | 10–600 (step 15) | Time in seconds for one complete filter cycle (IR→R→G→B→CH4→IR). Set this to match your actual capture cadence. Example: 45s × 5 filters = 225s. |
| **Min Quality Threshold** | 0.05 | 0.0–1.0 (step 0.05) | Frames below this quality score are excluded from window scoring. 0.0 = include all frames. 0.2–0.3 = remove clearly bad frames. **Setting too high may leave too few valid frames.** |

> **Note**: Step 03 enumerates **all** sliding windows in chronological order. Window selection (how many to keep and whether to allow overlap) is configured in Step 09 (Summary Grid).

> **Color camera mode**: The "Filter cycle (sec)" label changes to **"Single frame interval (sec)"** with a default of 45s. In this case, 1 frame = the time to capture one color frame.



### 6.2 Output Files

- `{filter}_ranking.csv`: Quality score list per TIF file for each filter
- `windows.json`: Detected optimal time window information
- `windows_summary.txt`: Human-readable window summary

---

## 7. Step 04 — De-rotation Stacking

![Step 04 panel](images_en/step04.png)
*Figure 7-1: Step 04 panel — De-rotation stacking configuration*

Stacks frames within the optimal windows detected in Step 03, correcting for planetary rotation during the process.

> **Required Step**: This step cannot be skipped.

### 7.1 Parameters

| Parameter | Default | Range | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------|-------------|
| **Input Folder** | Auto-set | — | Automatically set to the same Step 02 Lucky Stacking TIF folder as Step 03. |
| **Output Folder** | Auto-set | — | De-rotation stacked master TIF files are saved here. |
| **Min Quality Threshold** | 0.05 | 0.0–1.0 (step 0.05) | Frames below this quality score are excluded from stacking. Raise to 0.3–0.5 when seeing conditions are poor to more strictly filter bad frames. |
| **Normalize Brightness** | Off | — | Normalizes the brightness of each frame before stacking. Enable when frames have significant brightness variations due to changing seeing conditions. |
| **Satellite Composite** | Off | — | Composites Europa and its shadow using Skyfield BSP ephemeris. The status indicator next to the checkbox shows BSP file availability (see §7.3). |

### 7.2 JPL Horizons Integration

Step 04 automatically queries the NASA JPL Horizons API to retrieve the planet's north pole angle (NP.ang) at the time of observation. The **Horizons ID** in Global Settings must be set correctly. An internet connection is required.

### 7.3 Satellite / Shadow Composite

When **Satellite Composite** is checked, Europa and its shadow are handled separately from the planet de-rotation and blended into every filter stack.

**BSP status indicator** (coloured label next to the checkbox):

| Colour | Meaning | Action |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Green — OK | BSP ephemeris files present | Ready to use |
| Orange — `<files> — auto-download on first run` | Files missing; internet available | Files download automatically when the step runs (de440s.bsp 32 MB + jup365.bsp 1.1 GB) |
| Red — network error | No internet connection | Connect to internet, then re-open the panel |
| Red — `pip install skyfield` required | `skyfield` package not installed | Run `pip install skyfield` in the PlanetFlow environment |

**Cross-filter consistency**: Europa and its shadow are positioned at the same location **relative to the planet disk** in every filter's output TIF (IR, R, G, B, CH4). This guarantees that the satellite appears at the same location across all composites (IR-RGB, CH4-G-IR, etc.) after Step 06 channel alignment — regardless of sub-pixel differences in each filter's disk position.

## 8. Step 05 — Wavelet Master Sharpening

![Step 05 panel](images_en/step05.png)
*Figure 8-1: Step 05 panel — Master image wavelet sharpening (Left: controls, Right: live preview)*

Applies wavelet sharpening to the master TIF images generated by Step 04. Since master images result from stacking thousands of frames, their SNR is extremely high, allowing stronger sharpening than Step 07.

> **Required Step**: This step cannot be skipped.

### 8.1 Wavelet Levels (L1–L6)

Same structure as Step 07, but **stronger values can be safely used** since it's applied to master images.

| Level | Default | Recommended Range | Characteristics |
|-------|---------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **L1** | 200 | 100–400 | Highest-resolution pixel-level detail |
| **L2** | 200 | 100–400 | Fine structures (belts, streaks) |
| **L3** | 200 | 50–300 | Medium-scale structures |
| **L4** | 0 | 0–100 | Large-scale tonal contrast |
| **L5** | 0 | 0 | Not recommended |
| **L6** | 0 | 0 | Not recommended |

### 8.2 Live Preview

The right panel shows a live wavelet sharpening preview that refreshes automatically as you adjust the sliders.

> **Tip**: Master images have very high SNR, so raising L1 and L2 to 300–400 rarely produces artifacts. Tune Step 07 and Step 05 values independently for optimal results.

---

## 9. Step 06 — RGB Composite (Master)


Combines per-filter master PNGs from Step 05 into color images.

> **Required Step**: This step cannot be skipped.

The UI differs completely depending on camera mode.

---

![Step 06 mono panel](images_en/step06_mono.png)
*Figure 9-1: Step 06 panel — RGB composite settings with live preview*


### 9.A Mono Camera Mode

Multiple composite types (RGB, LRGB, false color) can be defined and produced in a single session.

#### 9.A.1 Base Parameters

| Parameter | Default | Range | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------|-------------|
| **Max Channel Shift (px)** | 15.0 | 0.0–100.0 | Maximum allowed shift in channel-to-channel phase correlation alignment. If the computed shift exceeds this value, alignment is skipped (prevents runaway misalignment). Raise to 20–30 on nights with strong atmospheric dispersion. |
| **Global Normalize** | On | — | When enabled, scales each window's composite so its mean luminance matches the cross-window average. Eliminates inter-window brightness flicker in the GIF output. |
| **Filter Normalize** | Off | — | When enabled, equalizes per-filter brightness across all windows before compositing. Computes the planet-disk median for each (filter, window) pair and scales each window so all windows share the same disk median per filter. Corrects atmospheric transparency differences without blowing out the dynamic range. |
| **Brightness Scale** | 1.0 | 0.1–2.0 (step 0.05) | Multiplier applied to the composite output brightness. 1.0 = unchanged. Values below 1.0 darken; values above 1.0 brighten. |

#### 9.A.2 Composite Specification Table

Each row defines one composite output image.

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **👁 (Radio Button)** | Selects which composite to display in the preview. Only one can be selected at a time. |
| **Name** | The name of the composite image. Used in the output filename (e.g., `RGB_composite.png`). |
| **R Channel** | Filter assigned to the red channel. |
| **G Channel** | Filter assigned to the green channel. |
| **B Channel** | Filter assigned to the blue channel. |
| **L Channel** | Filter assigned as luminance channel. Selecting this enables **LRGB compositing** mode. `──` = not used (plain RGB). |
| **✕** | Deletes this composite specification row. |

#### Default Composite Specs

| Name | R | G | B | L | Description |
|------|---|---|---|---|-------------|
| **RGB** | R | G | B | (none) | Standard 3-color composite |
| **IR-RGB** | R | G | B | IR | LRGB using IR as luminance. The IR channel's high resolution enhances fine luminance detail. |
| **CH4-G-IR** | CH4 | G | IR | (none) | Methane band false-color composite. Emphasizes Jupiter's cloud structure and the GRS. |

Use the **+ Add** button to add new composite specs with any filter combination you need.

#### 9.A.3 Live Preview

The right panel shows a live preview of the currently selected (radio button) composite. The preview refreshes automatically 400ms after changing any R/G/B/L dropdown.

> **Note**: The preview is computed without channel alignment (phase correlation) for speed. Alignment effects can be verified in the output files after running the step.

---

### 9.B Color Camera Mode

![Step 06 color panel](images_en/step06_color.png)
*Figure 9-2: Step 06 color camera mode — Auto white balance + CA correction preview*

In color camera mode, **automatic white balance (WB) + chromatic aberration (CA) correction** is applied automatically by the pipeline instead of manual channel assignment.

- **No configuration needed**: All corrections are determined algorithmically, computed independently per window.
- **"Refresh Preview" button**: Loads a Step 05 PNG and shows the auto-correction result.
- **Before/After panels**: Side-by-side comparison of the original and corrected images.
- **Channel gain graph**: Visualises the R/G/B gain (WB) and R/B channel shift (CA correction).

---

## 10. Step 07 — Wavelet Preview

![Step 07 panel](images_en/step07.png)
*Figure 10-1: Step 07 panel — Wavelet sharpening configuration*

Applies wavelet sharpening to TIF files output by Step 02 Lucky Stacking and converts them to PNG format. Used for visual preview and inspection purposes.

> **Optional Step**: Run this step when you want to visually inspect wavelet sharpening results before proceeding.

### 10.1 Parameters

| Parameter | Default | Range | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------|-------------|
| **Input Folder** | Auto-set | — | TIF folder to process. Auto-filled from the Step 02 output when Step 02 is enabled; otherwise type or browse to any TIF folder. |
| **Output Folder** | Auto-set | — | Set automatically to `step07_wavelet_preview` alongside the input folder. |
| **Apply color correction** | On | — | *(Color camera mode only)* Applies automatic white balance and chromatic aberration (CA) correction to the output PNGs. Disable only when you want the raw-color output for inspection. |

### 10.2 Wavelet Levels (L1–L6)

| Level | Default | Range | Characteristics |
|-------|---------|-------|-----------------|
| **L1** | 200 | 0–500 | Finest detail (pixel-level sharpening) |
| **L2** | 200 | 0–500 | Fine detail |
| **L3** | 200 | 0–500 | Medium detail |
| **L4** | 0 | 0–500 | Large-scale structures (risk of noise amplification) |
| **L5** | 0 | 0–500 | Even larger structures |
| **L6** | 0 | 0–500 | Largest structures |

- Sliders and number inputs are **bidirectionally synchronized**.
- It is recommended to **only activate L1–L3** for planetary imaging. L4 and above can excessively amplify noise.
- These values apply only to the preview sharpening in Step 07. Final master image sharpening is configured separately in Step 05.

---

## 11. Step 08 — Animated GIF

![Step 08 panel](images_en/step08.png)
*Figure 11-1: Step 08 panel — GIF animation configuration*

Combines the RGB composite images from Step 06 into a planetary rotation animation GIF.

> **Optional Step**: Only run when you want to produce a rotation animation.

### 11.1 Parameters

| Parameter | Default | Range | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------|-------------|
| **Input Folder** | Auto-set | — | Automatically set to the `step06_rgb_composite/` folder. |
| **Output Folder** | Auto-set | — | GIF file is saved here. |
| **FPS** | 6.0 | 1.0–30.0 (step 0.5) | GIF playback speed in frames per second. 6–10 FPS is typical for planetary rotation animations. |
| **Resize Factor** | 1.0 | 0.1–2.0 (step 0.1) | Output GIF size multiplier. 1.0 = original size, 0.5 = half size (reduces file size). |

---

## 12. Step 09 — Summary Grid

![Step 09 panel](images_en/step09.png)
*Figure 12-1: Step 09 panel — Summary grid with levels adjustment (Left: controls, Right: live preview)*

Applies levels correction to Step 06 RGB composite results and produces summary grid images. Used for generating final images for observation reports or forum posts.

Two output files are produced:

| File | Contents | When generated |
|------|----------|----------------|
| `summary_grid_simple.png` | Composites only (all camera modes) | Always |
| `summary_grid.png` | Composites (left) + filter images from Step 05 (right), same cell size | Mono mode only, when Step 05 output exists |

> **Optional Step**: Use only when needed.

### 12.1 Parameters

| Parameter | Default | Range | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------|-------------|
| **Input Folder (Step 06)** | Auto-set | — | Automatically set to the Step 06 RGB composite result folder. |
| **Input Folder (Step 05)** | Auto-set | — | Step 05 wavelet master folder. Used to populate the filter image zone in the two-zone grid (`summary_grid.png`). Only shown in mono mode. |
| **Output Folder** | Auto-set | — | Summary grid PNGs are saved here. |
| **N Best Windows** | 0 | 0–20 | Number of top-quality windows to include in the grid. **0 = All**: every window detected by Step 03 is included. **N > 0**: only the top N windows ranked by quality score are selected. |
| **Allow Window Overlap** | Off | — | When N Best Windows > 0, controls whether selected windows may overlap in time. **Off** (default): greedy non-overlapping selection — each selected window is temporally distinct. **On**: top-N windows by score regardless of overlap. |
| **Black Point** | 0.04 | 0.0–0.5 (step 0.01) | Pixels at or below this value are remapped to pure black (0). Suppresses background sky noise and gives the planet a clean dark border. Recommended range: **0.02–0.08**. |
| **Gamma** | 0.9 | 0.1–3.0 (step 0.05) | Brightness gamma correction. **1.0** = no correction / **< 1.0** = brighter (typically 0.8–1.0 recommended) / **> 1.0** = darker. |
| **Cell Size (px)** | 300 | 100–1024 (step 50) | Size in pixels of each composite image cell within the summary grid. |
| **Save Analytic View** | Off | — | When checked, generates one `window_XX_analytic.png` per time window in the `analytic/` subdirectory. Only available in mono mode. |

### 12.2 Live Preview

![analytic_view](./images/analytic_view_sample.png)

The right panel shows before/after levels adjustment previews. The preview automatically refreshes 400ms after changing any parameter.

### 12.3 Analytic View Metric Reference

The Analytic View (`window_XX_analytic.png`) generates one image per time window. Below each image, two metric blocks are displayed.

#### Per-filter metrics (directly below filter images, above the divider)

Values are column-aligned to the filter image above them.

| Metric | Meaning | How to read |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| **Frames** | `frames used / total frames` | A low ratio means many frames were rejected due to poor seeing or planet motion. Below 50% generally indicates poor observing conditions. |
| **Q.Post** | Mean quality score of the retained frames after outlier removal (0–1) | Higher is better. Absolute values vary by planet size and seeing conditions — relative comparison between filters in the same session is more useful than comparing across nights. |
| **Stab.** | Atmospheric stability (0–1) | Higher means quality varied little over time. A low value means seeing was turbulent and only a subset of frames were usable. |
| **Stacked** | Final number of frames summed in the lucky stack | Frames that passed an additional quality filter after the `Frames` selection step. |

#### Composite align table (below composite images, above the separator)

For each composite (RGB, IR-RGB, etc.), shows how much each filter image was shifted to align it as a channel in that composite.

- **Rows** = filter names (IR, R, G, B, CH4 …) — one row per filter used across any composite
- **Cell values** = `[role] shift` — `[role]` is the channel this filter fills in that composite (`[L]`, `[R]`, `[G]`, `[B]`), and `shift` is `(Δx, Δy)` in pixels
- **`[role] ref`** — this filter was used as the alignment reference for that composite (no shift applied)
- **`—`** — this filter is not used in that composite
- **`[Sat]`** row — saturation boost factor applied to each composite (1.00 = original saturation preserved)

#### Bottom global parameter line

| Metric | Meaning | How to read |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| **Win.Q** | Overall window quality score (0–1) | General seeing quality for the time window. Useful for comparing multiple windows within the same session. |
| **Rot** | Accumulated planetary rotation within the window (degrees) | Higher values make de-rotation correction more important. Jupiter rotates fast, so long windows can accumulate several degrees. |
| **Wvl** | Wavelet sharpening layer strengths `[L1 L2 L3 L4 L5 L6]` | Higher values emphasize that spatial frequency band more strongly. 0 disables that layer. |
| **bp** | Black point | Pixels at or below this value are clipped to pure black. Controls background sky suppression. |
| **γ** | Gamma correction | < 1.0 brightens midtones, > 1.0 darkens them. 1.0 = no correction. |

## 13. Run All

![Run All](images_en/run_all.png)
*Figure 13-1: Pipeline running state*

Clicking the Run All button in the left sidebar automatically executes all enabled steps in sequence.

### 13.1 Start Point

The button label changes dynamically based on whether Steps 01 and 02 are enabled.

| Condition | Button Label | Start Point | Validated Input |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Step 01 ✓ | **▶ Run from Step 1** | Step 01 | SER files (SER input folder) |
| Step 01 ✗, Step 02 ✓ | **▶ Run from Step 2** | Step 02 | SER files (Step 02 SER folder) |
| Step 01 ✗, Step 02 ✗ | **▶ Run from Step 3** | Step 03 | TIF files (input folder) |

> **Note**: Enabling Step 01 automatically enables and locks Step 02's checkbox.

### 13.2 Execution Flow

1. **Input validation**: Checks that input files exist in the starting step's folder. Aborts with a warning if none are found.
2. **Confirmation dialog**: Displays the list of steps to run, the number of input files, and the output path for each step. Click "Run" to proceed.
3. **Step-by-step execution**: Only enabled steps are executed; disabled optional steps are skipped.
4. **Error handling**: If an error occurs during execution, the pipeline halts at that step and an error message is printed to the log.

> **Auto-skip for de-rotation steps**: If the number of input TIF files is too small to form even one de-rotation window, Steps 03–06 and 08–09 are automatically skipped and only Step 07 (Wavelet Preview) runs. A warning banner in the confirmation dialog explains how many files were found and how many are required.

## 14. Output Folder Structure

After pipeline execution, the following folders are created under the output base folder (e.g., `260402_output/`):
