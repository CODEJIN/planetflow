## 1. Overview

This tool automates the planetary imaging post-processing pipeline. Starting from raw SER video capture, it guides you through PIPP preprocessing → Lucky Stacking → quality assessment → de-rotation stacking → wavelet sharpening → RGB compositing → time-series animation → summary grid generation, all from within the GUI.

### 1.1 Camera Modes

This pipeline supports two camera modes.

| Mode | Description | Filter Setup |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| **Mono** | Monochrome camera with a filter wheel. Separate SER file per filter. | Multiple filters: IR, R, G, B, CH4, etc. |
| **Color** | Single color (Bayer) camera. Continuous capture without filter switching. | COLOR (single channel) |

Selecting the camera mode in Global Settings automatically switches the UI and parameters in Steps 03, 06, and 08.

## 4. Step 01 — PIPP Preprocessing

![Step 01 panel](images_en/step01.png)
*Figure 4-1: Step 01 panel — Left: form, Right: SER frame preview*

Uses PIPP (Planetary Imaging PreProcessor) to crop SER videos centered on the planet and extract the Region of Interest (ROI).

> **Optional Step**: This step can be skipped if your SER files are already cropped or if you've run PIPP separately.

### 4.1 Parameters

| Parameter | Default | Range | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------|-------------|
| **SER Video Folder** | (Required) | — | Path to the folder containing SER files. Automatically searches all subfolders for `.SER` files. Browse with the `...` button or type the path directly. |
| **Output Folder** | Auto-set | — | Folder where PIPP-processed SER files will be saved. |
| **ROI Size (px)** | 448 | 64–1024 (step 16) | Square crop size for PIPP output. Set this large enough to encompass the planetary disc. 448–512px is typical for Jupiter. |
| **Min Disc Diameter (px)** | 50 | 10–500 (step 5) | Minimum disc size to be considered a valid planet detection. Frames where the detected disc is smaller than this value are discarded as bad frames. |

### 4.2 Live Preview

The right panel shows a live preview.

- **Cyan box (Planet)**: Automatically detected planet region
- **Green box (ROI)**: The area that will be cropped to the set ROI size

The preview automatically refreshes when ROI size or minimum diameter changes.

## 5. Step 02 — Lucky Stacking

![Step 02 panel](images_en/step02.png)
*Figure 5-1: Step 02 panel — Lucky Stacking configuration (Left: controls, Right: AP grid preview)*

Selects the best frames from SER files and stacks them into TIF files using **Fourier-domain quality-weighted stacking**. Processing is fully automated within the pipeline — no external program required. When Step 01 is enabled, its SER output folder is automatically connected as input.

> **Optional Step**: If TIF stacks have already been created by an external tool, skip this step and specify the folder directly in Step 03.
> Currently, the quality of the TIF extracted with AS!4 is superior to the internal lucky stacking method.
![tif_with_as!4_base](./images/TIF_with_AS!4_base.png)
![tif_with_step02_base](./images/TIF_Step02_base.png)

### 5.1 Parameters

| Parameter | Default | Range | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------|-------------|
| **SER Input Folder** | (Required) | — | Folder containing the SER files to Lucky Stack. When Step 01 is enabled, the Step 01 output folder is connected automatically. Browse with the `...` button or type the path directly. |
| **Output Folder** | Auto-set | — | Folder where Lucky Stacking result TIF files are saved. Automatically set to `step02_lucky_stack` relative to the SER input folder. |
| **Top Frame % (%)** | 25 % | 5–100 % (step 5) | Only the top N% of frames by quality score are used for stacking. Lower value = stricter selection (sharper result, lower noise); higher value = more frames included (higher SNR). Use 10–25% on nights of good seeing, 50–75% on nights of poor seeing. |
| **AP Size (px)** | 64 | 32–128 (step 32) | Alignment Point size. Size of the sub-region used for local shift estimation. **64px = default (recommended)**. 32px = finer local alignment (slower), 128px = broader reference area (faster). |
| **Iterations** | 1 | 1–2 | Number of Lucky Stacking iterations. Each iteration refines the AP alignment reference using the previous stack result. **1** = default (fast); **2** = higher accuracy at ~2× processing time. |
| **σ-clip** | Off | — | Enables a sigma-clipping post-pass after the main stack. Re-warps all selected frames to the final reference and discards pixels that deviate more than κσ from the per-pixel mean. Significantly reduces cosmic-ray hits and hot-pixel residuals at the cost of ~2× processing time. |
| **Fourier Quality Power** | 1.0 | 0.5–3.0 (step 0.5) | Exponent applied to each frame's Fourier amplitude when computing per-frequency weights: `w = │FFT│^power`. **1.0** = linear weighting (default, recommended), **0.5** = gentler weighting (more frames contribute equally, closer to uniform average), **2.0+** = only the sharpest frames dominate. For most sessions, keep this at 1.0. |
| **SER Parallel Workers** | 1 | 0–32 | Number of SER files to process simultaneously. **0** = auto (cpu_count ÷ 4). **1** = sequential (default, safe for low-RAM systems). When set above 1, each SER gets `n_workers ÷ n_ser_parallel` internal frame-level threads so total CPU usage stays bounded. **Warning: high values multiply RAM usage** (each SER loads its full frame buffer independently). |
| **AS!4 AP Grid** | Off | — | When enabled, AP positions are generated using the same greedy Poisson-disc sampling (PDS) algorithm as AutoStakkert!4: three-tier radial density with denser coverage at the disc centre. When disabled, a uniform grid is used. The right-panel preview updates immediately when toggled. |

### 5.2 AP Grid Preview

The right panel shows the first frame from the selected SER folder overlaid with the AP (Alignment Point) grid.

- **AP (uniform)**: uniform grid, spacing = AP size ÷ 2.
- **AP (AS!4 PDS)**: three-layer Poisson-disc grid matching AutoStakkert!4 density — denser at the disc centre, sparser at the limb.

The preview refreshes automatically when AP size changes or the AS!4 AP Grid checkbox is toggled.

### 5.3 Stacking Algorithm

Lucky Stacking uses **Fourier-domain quality-weighted stacking**:

1. Each selected frame `n` is globally shift-aligned to the reference.
2. Its 2-D FFT `F_n(f)` is computed.
3. At each spatial frequency `f`, the frame contributes with weight `w_n(f) = │F_n(f)│^power`.
4. The final image is reconstructed via IFFT of the weighted-average spectrum.

Frames that are sharper (higher Fourier amplitude at high frequencies due to good seeing) automatically contribute more at those frequencies — a per-frequency lucky selection without hard spatial patch boundaries.

**Parallelism model** (e.g., 32 cores, 4 SER parallel):
```
Total thread budget = n_workers (default: all cores)
SER-level:  4 SER files processed simultaneously
Frame-level: each SER uses n_workers ÷ 4 = 8 threads
Peak active threads = 4 × 8 = 32 = n_workers
```
Both σ-clip warping and Fourier chunk accumulation use the same per-SER thread pool (sequentially within one SER, but overlapping across SER files).

---

## 6. Step 03 — Quality Assessment & Window Detection

![Step 03 panel](images_en/step03.png)
*Figure 6-1: Step 03 panel — Quality assessment configuration*

Automatically evaluates the image quality of each TIF frame and detects the optimal time window for stacking.

> **Required Step**: This step cannot be skipped.

### 6.1 Parameters

| Parameter | Default | Range | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------|-------------|
| **Input Folder** | Auto-set | — | Automatically set to the Step 02 Lucky Stacking TIF folder. |
| **Output Folder** | Auto-set | — | Quality score CSVs and window recommendation JSON are saved here. |
| **Window (frames)** | 3 | 1–20 | De-rotation window length expressed as **number of filter cycles**. 1 frame = one complete filter cycle (IR→R→G→B→CH4). Actual window time = frames × filter cycle time. Example: 3 frames × 225s = 675s (~11 min). **Jupiter: 2–4 frames / Mars, Saturn: 3–6 frames** |
| **Filter cycle (sec)** | 225 | 10–600 (step 15) | Time in seconds for one complete filter cycle (IR→R→G→B→CH4→IR). Set this to match your actual capture cadence. Example: 45s × 5 filters = 225s. **This value is used only for Step 03 window length calculation.** Step 08 has its own independent cycle time setting. |
| **Number of Windows** | 1 | 1–10 | Number of optimal windows to detect. **1**: Find only the single best window (for Step 04 stacking). **2–3**: Detect multiple windows at different epochs (for Step 08 time-series). |
| **Allow Overlap** | Off | — | Checked: Detected windows may overlap in time. Unchecked: Each window is non-overlapping (default). |
| **Min Quality Threshold** | 0.05 | 0.0–1.0 (step 0.05) | Frames below this quality score are excluded from window optimization. 0.0 = include all frames. 0.2–0.3 = remove clearly bad frames. **Setting too high may leave too few valid frames.** |

> **Color camera mode**: The "Filter cycle (sec)" label changes to **"Single frame interval (sec)"** with a default of 45s. In this case, 1 frame = the time to capture one color frame.

### 6.2 Output Files

- `{filter}_ranking.csv`: Quality score list per TIF file for each filter
- `windows.json`: Detected optimal time window information
- `windows_summary.txt`: Human-readable window summary

---

## 7. Step 04 — De-rotation Stacking

![Step 04 panel](images_en/step04.png)
*Figure 7-1: Step 04 panel — De-rotation stacking configuration*

Stacks frames within the optimal windows detected in Step 03, correcting for planetary rotation during the process.

> **Required Step**: This step cannot be skipped.

### 7.1 Parameters

| Parameter | Default | Range | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------|-------------|
| **Input Folder** | Auto-set | — | Automatically set to the same Step 02 Lucky Stacking TIF folder as Step 03. |
| **Output Folder** | Auto-set | — | De-rotation stacked master TIF files are saved here. |
| **Warp Scale** | 0.80 | 0.0–2.0 (step 0.01) | Spherical distortion correction strength. Because a planet is a sphere, the disc centre moves significantly with rotation while the limb barely moves. Warp scale controls the magnitude of this depth-dependent per-pixel correction. **0.0** = no correction (uniform shift), **1.0** = theoretical full sphere correction, **0.80** = recommended for Jupiter in typical seeing. On nights of exceptional seeing, try 1.0–1.2. |
| **Min Quality Threshold** | 0.05 | 0.0–1.0 (step 0.05) | Frames below this quality score are excluded from stacking. Raise to 0.3–0.5 when seeing conditions are poor to more strictly filter bad frames. |
| **Normalize Brightness** | Off | — | Normalizes the brightness of each frame before stacking. Enable when frames have significant brightness variations due to changing seeing conditions. |

### 7.2 Warp Scale Auto-Tune

The **"▶ Auto-tune scale"** button inside the panel sweeps warp scale values and automatically finds the value that maximises stack sharpness (Laplacian variance), based on Step 03 data.

- Only becomes active after Step 03 has been run.
- Takes approximately 2–4 seconds.
- Results are shown in orange (low confidence, improvement < 3%) or green (high confidence).
- The auto-tuned value is a starting point — manual fine-tuning afterwards is recommended.

### 7.3 JPL Horizons Integration

Step 04 automatically queries the NASA JPL Horizons API to retrieve the planet's north pole angle (NP.ang) at the time of observation. The **Horizons ID** in Global Settings must be set correctly. An internet connection is required.

---

## 8. Step 05 — Wavelet Master Sharpening

![Step 05 panel](images_en/step05.png)
*Figure 8-1: Step 05 panel — Master image wavelet sharpening (Left: controls, Right: live preview)*

Applies wavelet sharpening to the master TIF images generated by Step 04. Since master images result from stacking thousands of frames, their SNR is extremely high, allowing stronger sharpening than Step 07.

> **Required Step**: This step cannot be skipped.

### 8.1 Wavelet Levels (L1–L6)

Same structure as Step 07, but **stronger values can be safely used** since it's applied to master images.

| Level | Default | Recommended Range | Characteristics |
|-------|---------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **L1** | 200 | 100–400 | Highest-resolution pixel-level detail |
| **L2** | 200 | 100–400 | Fine structures (belts, streaks) |
| **L3** | 200 | 50–300 | Medium-scale structures |
| **L4** | 0 | 0–100 | Large-scale tonal contrast |
| **L5** | 0 | 0 | Not recommended |
| **L6** | 0 | 0 | Not recommended |

### 8.2 Live Preview

The right panel shows a live wavelet sharpening preview that refreshes automatically as you adjust the sliders.

> **Tip**: Master images have very high SNR, so raising L1 and L2 to 300–400 rarely produces artifacts. Tune Step 07 and Step 05 values independently for optimal results.

---

## 9. Step 06 — RGB Composite (Master)


Combines per-filter master PNGs from Step 05 into color images.

> **Required Step**: This step cannot be skipped.

The UI differs completely depending on camera mode.

---

![Step 06 mono panel](images_en/step06_mono.png)
*Figure 9-1: Step 06 panel — RGB composite settings with live preview*


### 9.A Mono Camera Mode

Multiple composite types (RGB, LRGB, false color) can be defined and produced in a single session.

#### 9.A.1 Base Parameters

| Parameter | Default | Range | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------|-------------|
| **Max Channel Shift (px)** | 15.0 | 0.0–100.0 | Maximum allowed shift in channel-to-channel phase correlation alignment. If the computed shift exceeds this value, alignment is skipped (prevents runaway misalignment). Raise to 20–30 on nights with strong atmospheric dispersion. |

#### 9.A.2 Composite Specification Table

Each row defines one composite output image.

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **👁 (Radio Button)** | Selects which composite to display in the preview. Only one can be selected at a time. |
| **Name** | The name of the composite image. Used in the output filename (e.g., `RGB_composite.png`). |
| **R Channel** | Filter assigned to the red channel. |
| **G Channel** | Filter assigned to the green channel. |
| **B Channel** | Filter assigned to the blue channel. |
| **L Channel** | Filter assigned as luminance channel. Selecting this enables **LRGB compositing** mode. `──` = not used (plain RGB). |
| **✕** | Deletes this composite specification row. |

#### Default Composite Specs

| Name | R | G | B | L | Description |
|------|---|---|---|---|-------------|
| **RGB** | R | G | B | (none) | Standard 3-color composite |
| **IR-RGB** | R | G | B | IR | LRGB using IR as luminance. The IR channel's high resolution enhances fine luminance detail. |
| **CH4-G-IR** | CH4 | G | IR | (none) | Methane band false-color composite. Emphasizes Jupiter's cloud structure and the GRS. |

Use the **+ Add** button to add new composite specs with any filter combination you need.

#### 9.A.3 Live Preview

The right panel shows a live preview of the currently selected (radio button) composite. The preview refreshes automatically 400ms after changing any R/G/B/L dropdown.

> **Note**: The preview is computed without channel alignment (phase correlation) for speed. Alignment effects can be verified in the output files after running the step.

---

### 9.B Color Camera Mode

![Step 06 color panel](images_en/step06_color.png)
*Figure 9-2: Step 06 color camera mode — Auto white balance + CA correction preview*

In color camera mode, **automatic white balance (WB) + chromatic aberration (CA) correction** is applied automatically by the pipeline instead of manual channel assignment.

- **No configuration needed**: All corrections are determined algorithmically, computed independently per window.
- **"Refresh Preview" button**: Loads a Step 05 PNG and shows the auto-correction result.
- **Before/After panels**: Side-by-side comparison of the original and corrected images.
- **Channel gain graph**: Visualises the R/G/B gain (WB) and R/B channel shift (CA correction).

---

## 10. Step 07 — Wavelet Preview

![Step 07 panel](images_en/step07.png)
*Figure 10-1: Step 07 panel — Wavelet sharpening configuration*

Applies wavelet sharpening to TIF files output by Step 02 Lucky Stacking and converts them to PNG format. Used for visual preview and inspection purposes.

> **Optional Step**: Run this step when you want to visually inspect wavelet sharpening results before proceeding.

### 10.1 Parameters

| Parameter | Default | Range | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------|-------------|
| **Input Folder** | Auto-set | — | Automatically set to the Step 02 Lucky Stacking TIF folder. |
| **Output Base Folder** | (Required) | — | Parent folder where all step results are saved. Input/output folders for Steps 07 and beyond are automatically configured under this directory. |

### 10.2 Wavelet Levels (L1–L6)

| Level | Default | Range | Characteristics |
|-------|---------|-------|-----------------|
| **L1** | 200 | 0–500 | Finest detail (pixel-level sharpening) |
| **L2** | 200 | 0–500 | Fine detail |
| **L3** | 200 | 0–500 | Medium detail |
| **L4** | 0 | 0–500 | Large-scale structures (risk of noise amplification) |
| **L5** | 0 | 0–500 | Even larger structures |
| **L6** | 0 | 0–500 | Largest structures |

- Sliders and number inputs are **bidirectionally synchronized**.
- It is recommended to **only activate L1–L3** for planetary imaging. L4 and above can excessively amplify noise.
- These values apply only to the preview sharpening in Step 07. Final master image sharpening is configured separately in Step 05.

---

## 11. Step 08 — Time-Series RGB Composite

Uses **Step 02 Lucky Stacking TIF files** to create time-series RGB composite images at different epochs. Applies sliding-window stacking and its own wavelet sharpening independently from Step 07. Used for planetary rotation time-series analysis and GIF animation.

> **Optional Step**: Skip if time-series compositing is not needed.

> **Important**: Step 08 uses its **own independent composite specs** — it does not re-use Step 06 settings. It reads Step 02 TIF files directly and applies its own wavelet sharpening, independent of Step 07.

The parameters shown differ depending on camera mode.

---

### 11.A Mono Camera Mode
![Step 08 mono panel](images_en/step08_mono.png)
*Figure 11-1: Step 08 mono panel — Time-series composite settings*

#### 11.A.1 Parameters

| Parameter | Default | Range | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------|-------------|
| **Global filter normalize** | On | — | Unifies the brightness range of each filter across all frames. Greatly reduces colour inconsistency between frames in Step 09 GIFs. **Recommended when using Step 09.** |
| **Brightness scale** | 1.00 | 0.1–1.0 (step 0.05) | Multiplier applied to composite brightness. 1.0 = unchanged, 0.80 = 80% brightness. |
| **Window (frames)** | 3 | 1–9 (odd recommended) | Sliding-window stacking frame count. 1 = single frame, 3 = ±1 frame (SNR ×√3), 5 = ±2 frames (SNR ×√5). Recommended upper limit for Jupiter: 5 frames (~20 min). |
| **Filter cycle (seconds)** | 225 | 10–600 (step 15) | Time for one complete filter cycle (IR→R→G→B→CH4→IR). Used to group Step 07 PNGs into per-epoch time-series sets. **Set independently from Step 03's filter cycle time.** |
| **Min quality filter** | 0.05 | 0.0–0.9 (step 0.05) | Quality filter for frames (0.0 = no filter). Low-quality frames receive reduced weighting (soft down-weighting, not hard exclusion). |
| **Save mono filter GIFs** | Off | — | When checked: saves each filter's monochrome frames alongside the color composites. Step 09 will also generate per-filter monochrome GIFs. |

#### 11.A.2 Wavelet Sharpening (Series)

Independent wavelet sharpening settings applied to each time-series frame. Separate from Step 05.

| Level | Default | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| L1–L6 | [200, 200, 200, 0, 0, 0] | Same structure as Step 05. Applied only to time-series frames. |

#### 11.A.3 Series Composite Specs (Independent from Step 06)

Defines composite channels specifically for the time-series, **independently of Step 06's composite specs**. The table structure is identical to Step 06 (Name, R/G/B/L channels, delete button).

Default specs: RGB, IR-RGB, CH4-G-IR (same as Step 06 defaults)

---

### 11.B Color Camera Mode
![Step 08 color panel](images_en/step08_color.png)
*Figure 11-2: Step 08 color panel — Time-series composite settings*

In color camera mode, continuous COLOR channel frames are stacked using a sliding window.

| Parameter | Default | Range | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------|-------------|
| **Brightness scale** | 1.00 | 0.1–1.0 (step 0.05) | Same as mono mode. |
| **Capture interval (sec)** | 30 | 5–300 (step 5) | Continuous color capture interval in seconds. Unlike the mono "filter cycle", this is the time between individual color frames. |
| **Window (frames)** | 5 | 1–99 (odd recommended) | Sliding-window stacking frame count. Color cameras capture faster, so larger values are practical. |
| **Min quality filter** | 0.05 | 0.0–0.9 (step 0.05) | Same as mono mode. |
| **Wavelet sharpening** | [200, 200, 200, 0, 0, 0] | — | Wavelet sharpening applied after stacking. |

Processing order: sliding-window stacking → wavelet sharpening → auto WB + CA correction

*Figure 12-1: Step 09 panel — GIF animation configuration*

Combines the time-series composite results from Step 08 into a planetary rotation animation GIF.

> **Optional Step**: Only available when Step 08 has been run.

### 12.1 Parameters

| Parameter | Default | Range | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------|-------------|
| **Input Folder** | Auto-set | — | Automatically set to the Step 08 time-series PNG folder. |
| **Output Folder** | Auto-set | — | GIF file is saved here. |
| **FPS** | 6.0 | 1.0–30.0 (step 0.5) | GIF playback speed in frames per second. 6–10 FPS is typical for planetary rotation animations. |
| **Resize Factor** | 1.0 | 0.1–2.0 (step 0.1) | Output GIF size multiplier. 1.0 = original size, 0.5 = half size (reduces file size). |

## 13. Step 10 — Summary Grid

![Step 10 panel](images_en/step10.png)
*Figure 13-1: Step 10 panel — Summary grid with levels adjustment (Left: controls, Right: live preview)*

Applies levels correction to Step 06 RGB composite results and combines them into a single summary grid image. Used for generating final images for observation reports or forum posts.

> **Optional Step**: Use only when needed.

### 13.1 Parameters

| Parameter | Default | Range | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------|-------------|
| **Input Folder** | Auto-set | — | Automatically set to the Step 06 RGB composite result folder. |
| **Output Folder** | Auto-set | — | Summary grid PNG is saved here. |
| **Black Point** | 0.04 | 0.0–0.5 (step 0.01) | Pixels at or below this value are remapped to pure black (0). Suppresses background sky noise and gives the planet a clean dark border. Recommended range: **0.02–0.08**. |
| **Gamma** | 0.9 | 0.1–3.0 (step 0.05) | Brightness gamma correction. **1.0** = no correction / **< 1.0** = brighter (typically 0.8–1.0 recommended) / **> 1.0** = darker. |
| **Cell Size (px)** | 300 | 100–1024 (step 50) | Size in pixels of each composite image cell within the summary grid. |

### 13.2 Live Preview

The right panel shows before/after levels adjustment previews. The preview automatically refreshes 400ms after changing any parameter.

## 14. Run All

![Run All](images_en/run_all.png)
*Figure 14-1: Pipeline running state*

Clicking the Run All button in the left sidebar automatically executes all enabled steps in sequence.

### 14.1 Start Point

The button label changes dynamically based on whether Steps 01 and 02 are enabled.

| Condition | Button Label | Start Point | Validated Input |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Step 01 ✓ | **▶ Run from Step 1** | Step 01 | SER files (SER input folder) |
| Step 01 ✗, Step 02 ✓ | **▶ Run from Step 2** | Step 02 | SER files (Step 02 SER folder) |
| Step 01 ✗, Step 02 ✗ | **▶ Run from Step 3** | Step 03 | TIF files (input folder) |

> **Note**: Enabling Step 01 automatically enables and locks Step 02's checkbox.

### 14.2 Execution Flow

1. **Input validation**: Checks that input files exist in the starting step's folder. Aborts with a warning if none are found.
2. **Confirmation dialog**: Displays the list of steps to run, the number of input files, and the output path for each step. Click "Run" to proceed.
3. **Step-by-step execution**: Only enabled steps are executed; disabled optional steps are skipped.
4. **Error handling**: If an error occurs during execution, the pipeline halts at that step and an error message is printed to the log.

> **Step 09 dependency**: Enabling Step 09 (Animated GIF) automatically enables Step 08 (Time-Series Composite).

## 15. Output Folder Structure

After pipeline execution, the following folders are created under the output base folder (e.g., `260402_output/`):
